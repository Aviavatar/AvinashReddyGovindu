This project is an IOT based device to find the pH,water level,Light intensity and temparature of the water and its surrounding environment.
In this I used ESP8266 micro controller/nodeMCU and a 4 in 1 pH sensor board.
The output we get is a float value of pH of water and also a string givng the details about pH of water,water depth,surrounding light intensity and temparature.
